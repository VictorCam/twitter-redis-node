LIKE TWITTER BUT DIFFERENT


//200 as the limit for pub-sub
//INBOX
pub-sub = notifications only
//persist in the inbox
mentions/likes/re = pub-sub?
//total (101)


10000 = FOLLOWING LIMIT? (maybe more (per day?))


we can skip a user if we are tired of seeing their posts (updates to the last post seen) or we can go to their recommended list
(alt: we could do the users recommended list as well to be mixed in)
