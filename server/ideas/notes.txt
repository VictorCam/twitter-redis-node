==check if username or email is taken [login]==
redis: search username or email
kvrocks: if(user||email) disallow : make account

==updating a users personal information==
redis: update hash username and/or email
kvrocks: update userid username and/or email

get the post permission if allowed to post certain things

consider using the npm package dayjs on frontend only

on userid add [balance]

on each post add [revenue]

view a post

count the post 1 for a user (do not count duplicates) but count it for ad api counts

api via stripe for buying ad and api to see and accept ad api and api using seedweed false

in the FUTURE make the api for doing image searches

do an api for voting/bidding (multiple bids at the same time)/commission status/forms/transfering money

maybe allow text posts on timelines but txt files do not generate revenue

api for users who are open for commission api that shows ads sfw or nsfw dpeneidngo on account on account settings and age

art posts /videos// vid stream exclustive posts
watch list of tags --prevent abuse (post tag verfiers) -> limit large abitrary taggging -> allow 10 last of tags to watch

we can do a subscription using a hash where we have the user check if their subscription:id exists then with the key of the username and the timestamp
if it does not exist then that means that we don't have a subscription in place and if it does but it is expired then we tell them that their subscription is expired but they can renew it if they need to

how are we going to search things up if we don't have any sort of way to find things

I was thinking about having different sorted sets for posting
when a user posts a post there will be different sorted sets according to the preferences of the user
one will contain posts and rehowls
another will contain just posts
or we could make an api call that combines them together (with the expense of doing more network calls)

rename the word "READ" on the feed to something thats akin to "posts that are left to read"
synonyms for the word "posts that are left to read"
