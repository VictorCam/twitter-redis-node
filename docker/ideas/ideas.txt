6 | userc = no more posts
8 | usera = no more posts
9 | userb = no more posts

get the lowest UNIX 6 is the lowest but it has no more posts and since lowest has no posts then we go to fetch the next 3 users from the server


once there are no more posts
to be fetched aka 0 replies

then we update it to the current timestamp of the user we are following
(either their last post or time right now if possible which ever one is more efficent and convient)
