LIKE TWITTER BUT DIFFERENT


//100 as the limit for pub-sub
//INBOX
pub-sub = notifications only
//persist in the inbox
mentions/likes/re = pub-sub?

//total (101)


10000 //LIMIT! (maybe more :D)

//TIMELINE
grab one user at a time user a UNIX timestamp

we can skip a user if we are tired of seeing their posts or we can go to their recommended list

(alt: we could do the users recommended list as well to be mixed in)

double check the joi schemas

//instead of consuming more api requests use redis to grab the 10 users with the lowest last seen posts by timestamp
//then we grab the next 10 when we see
