-frequently updated data
counter data gets stored in redis then eventually stored in cass

-searching
search data gets stored in redis NEVER stored in cass
store in cass then SET keywords in redis then DEL (since it's quick)

searching in comments section store in cass then SET it all in redis then DEL (since it's quick)

-consistency
cass is set to all nodes for authentication on a (seperate keyspace?)
